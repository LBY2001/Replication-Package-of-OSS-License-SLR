# Systematic Literature Review (SLR) Process

## Overview
This repository provides a structured and transparent methodology for conducting an **SLR** on OSS License management. The process follows established guidelines to ensure a rigorous and reproducible selection of relevant studies. This repository is intended for reviewers, researchers, and readers who wish to understand the selection and screening process behind the final collection of papers.

## SLR Process Flowchart
The following flowchart illustrates the systematic workflow used for study selection:

## Methodology
The SLR process consists of the following key steps:

### 1. Identification
   - Conduct database searches in major research repositories (e.g., **IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, dblp**).
   - Retrieve an initial pool of studies.

### 2. Screening
   - **Duplicate Removal**: Remove redundant papers.
   - **Title and Abstract Screening**: Exclude studies based on predefined exclusion criteria:
     - EC1: Not written in English.
     - EC2: Not peer-reviewed.
     - EC3: Outside the defined research scope.
   - **Full-Text Assessment**: Exclude studies that:
     - EC4: Are unavailable.
     - EC5: Are from low-quality venues.
     - EC6: Contain irrelevant content.
     - EC7: Are extended versions of other included studies.

### 3. Inclusion
   - **Preliminary Inclusion**: Studies passing the above criteria are included.
   - **Snowballing**: Forward and backward snowballing techniques are applied to identify additional relevant studies.
   - **Final Study Selection**: After iterative filtering, a final set of papers is determined.

## Final Set of Studies
The following is the final list of selected papers that met all inclusion criteria:
